# Mogul Continuous Organization

## Continuous Organization
Continuous Organizations (C-Org) is innovative method for group-sourcing funds for different initiatives. Through a C-Org, new business models can be devised and capital intensive investment opportunities can be opened up to investors with large and small budgets. 

In their nature C-Orgs are a way to funnel investment from the crypto-digital world into the real world. When an investor invests funds into the CO, through cryptocurrency in a smart contract, they receive back tokens. You can think of these tokens as shares. 

The main goal for a C-Org is to use the invested funds and make such an investments so that they pay back dividends. These dividends are increasing the value of the tokens owned by the investors. 

In addition, in order to balance the risk-reward ratio of the early investors (who naturally take the most risk), the C-Org investment/tokens buy and sell ratios is governed by a complex mathematical model. Some of the rules of this model are outlined below:

- The buy and sell mathematical formulas are devised in such a way that at a given time, the buy price is higher than the sell price. This means that if you buy a single token now and sell it right away you will incur a substantial loss. Therefore, you are incentivized to hold for dividend payout or more people joining the C-Org after you.
- The less C-Org tokens are there in circulation - the lower (better) the price per single token bought is, and vice versa. This rewards the early investors for their high risk investment. They also get more pro rata dividends. 
- The more C-Org tokens are in circulation - the better the sell price for a single token is. This disinsentivizes pump-and-dump actions towards the token

## Mogul Productions

One such undertaking is the Mogul Productions innovative method for group-sourcing funds for movies production. 

Mogul Productions has built their own C-Org in order to group-source funds to invest in movies, and is the first live C-Org that is known. Unique specifications have also been used in the Mogul model. The tokens received by the investors will be used for voting on a film to be invested in using a quadratic voting forumla. The choices of films that an investor can invest in is selected by a highly qualified panel. The investors can vote in accordance with the amount of CO tokens they hold.

The project consists of two major parts - the continuous organization smart contract system and the voting system. Both of them have their own dedicated overview and specification pages:

- [Voting System](docs/VotingContract.md)
